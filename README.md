TextSecure Chromium Implementation
==================================

This is very early stuff and exists primarily to get the crypto in place.
It is currently chromium-only as it uses NaCL for Curve25519 stuff, but I'd be
glad to accept a pull that abstracts out the NaCL-specific stuff to optionally
use a JS implementation for FF.
Note that the code is currently quite messy (its all in one file!), but it
needs to work first, then it can be heavily cleaned up later.
